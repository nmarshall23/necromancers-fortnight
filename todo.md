Ore Distubuation
----------------
Look into how Embvers Default for it's ores is.

### Lead
Far too hard to find. Needs to be more common. 

### Lapis

Far too hard to find. Should there be more depots of it? 

### Railcraft like Geodes

Could I add custom blocks like RC darkstone? Can I use RC darkstone?
Mayb they don't need diamonds just lapis and Emerals.

Disable any dup plants from other mods.

Fix Rustic Bees honeycomb, and harvestcraft honey drops.

Tests Done 
----------

Yes, Tinkers, fluid amount needed for plates can be changed.
