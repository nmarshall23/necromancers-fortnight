# Q1 - Quest Start Dialog Punching Trees
    I'm running low on Planks could you cut down a tree or two? And give me 8 planks?

# Q1 - Active Dialog
    Get to chopping! You know that punching trees will not give you a log. Instead you will gain only one plank. Use an Axe to harvest logs. However to get planks, you need to split logs by placing the log in the crafting grid log with an Axe of harvest level of Iron or better.

# Q1 - QuestLog text
    Collect 8 Planks.

# Q2 - Quest Start Dialog Cooking Charcoal
    I have run out of charcoal for my furnace. Build a charcoal pit and give me 10 charcoal.

    The furnace doesn't get hot enought to make charcoal from logs. You will need to make a Charcoal Pit. And fill it with Wood Piles.
