# A Young Lady's Primer

There is a terrible power within you. It might be best to never let it free. 

But if you must, be aware that the last time this power was explored we lost dear friends and a world was destroyed. 

Be warry of Endermen for they will know your power. Do not trust the Order of the Owl, for they wait to see if your power awakens.

Never set foot in the Nether, the fiends that call that home will try to enslave you.

See out Druids perhaps they have found a method of redirecting the power from death to life.
