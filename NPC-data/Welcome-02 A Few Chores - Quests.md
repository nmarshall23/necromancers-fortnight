    Get to chopping! You know that punching trees will not give you a log. Instead you will gain only one plank. Use an Axe to harvest logs. However to get planks, you need to split logs by placing the log in the crafting grid log with an Axe of harvest level of Iron or better.

## Q3 - Cooking Charcoal

The player knows how to get charcoal.

### Q3 - Start Dialog

    I have run out of charcoal for my furnace. Build a charcoal pit and give me 10 charcoal.

    The furnace doesn't get hot enought to make charcoal from logs. You will need to make a Charcoal Pit. And fill it with Wood Piles.

## Q3 - Active Dialog

    Have you made the Charcoal pit? It will take a full day or two for it to finish burning into charcoal. While you are waiting go collect some seeds, or tame a chicken or goat. Just don't let any wildlife into my garden!

## Q3 - QuestLog text

    To make a charcoal pit. Craft several Wood Piles each requiring four logs. Lay out a connected Wood Piles structure. They need to be touching each other. Place a fireproof block on every open Wood Pile face. That includes the bottem. Use Dirt for now, other fireproof blocks will result in more charcoal. Leave one block open for ignition. Use a Fire Starter to ignite one Wood Pile. Cover up the fire with a fireproof block. Don't worry place the block on the fire. The Wood Pile will still burn. If there are smoke particles around your charcoal pit it is running. Wait until the smoke particles are gone. This takes a good amount of time!

## Q3 - Quset Completed text

    Maybe you are not lazy after all. Good Work.

## Q4 - Collect Crops

The player knows food has been changed.

### Q4 - Start Dialog

    Now that I have charcoal I can cook my dinner. You should know that you can't eat the same stuff over and over and expect that it will fill your belly. Until recently I had a full garden, with a variety of crops. Then some pigs got in it and have eated all of my Corn and Tomato plants.

    Those birds nests you have been collecting might have a seed or two in them. You can also find small clusters of crops. Often you can collect seeds from the crop and replant them.

    Find me 4 Corn on the Cob, and 4 Tomatos.

## Q4 - Quest Active Dialog

    You know what would be great with what I am cooking.. Eggs. I'd like to make you one of my omelettes. If we had a pig we could find truffles.

    Did you know if you tame a pig and take them on a walk using a lead in the forest they will dig up truffles for you?

    - You know this is a lot of work.

## Q4 - Quest Active Dialog 2

    Which would you rather have a bed to sleep in and an omelette in the morning, or not?

    Soon as you are done, I will dig threw my things and find my grandmothers old book diary. She was one of the Heroes of Legend that sealed away the Necromancer.

    If you do find any animals you will need to fence them away from my crops. Just last week a goat got into my garden and ate all of corn, and tomato's. He didn't even leave me any seeds to replant them.

    Also animals will need access to water. You could craft a Trough to leave food in.

## Q4 - QuestLog text

    Find Corn Seeds in Birds nests. Find Tomato seeds in grass. Turn in 4 corn on the cob, and 4 Tomatos. Tomatos are grown on Wooden Stakes.
