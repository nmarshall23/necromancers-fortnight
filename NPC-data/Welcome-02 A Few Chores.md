# Q1 - Quest Start Dialog Punching Trees
    I'm running low on Planks could you cut down a tree or two? And give me 8 Planks?

# Q1 - Active Dialog
    Get to chopping! You know that punching trees will not give you a log. Instead you will gain only one plank. Use an Axe to harvest logs. However to get planks, you need to split logs by placing the log in the crafting grid log with an Axe of harvest level of Iron or better.

# Q2 - Start Dialog - Tools to Tinker With
    Great, You are going to need to make some tools. A wandering tinker told me about a fantasic way of crafting tools. You will need to craft a Tool Station, Part Builder, Stencil Table, Pattern Chest and Crafting Station.

# Q2 - Active Dialog
    I got plenty of other things to do. I can't stand here and watch you all day.

    Great job. Now make yourself a flint Pickaxe.

# Q3 - Start Dialog - Cooking Charcoal
    I have run out of charcoal for my furnace. Build a charcoal pit and give me 10 charcoal.

    The furnace doesn't get hot enought to make charcoal from logs. You will need to make a Charcoal Pit. And fill it with Wood Piles.

# Q3 - Active Dialog
    Have you made the Charcoal pit? It will take a full day or two for it to finish burning into charcoal. While you are waiting go collect some seeds, or tame a chicken or goat. Just don't let any wildlife into my garden!

# Q3 - QuestLog text
    To make a charcoal pit. Craft several Wood Piles each requiring four logs. Lay out a connected Wood Piles structure. They need to be touching each other. Place a fireproof block on every open Wood Pile face. That includes the bottem. Use Dirt for now, other fireproof blocks will result in more charcoal. Leave one block open for ignition. Use a Fire Starter to ignite one Wood Pile. Cover up the fire with a fireproof block. Don't worry place the block on the fire. The Wood Pile will still burn. If there are smoke particles around your charcoal pit it is running. Wait until the smoke particles are gone. This takes a good amount of time!

    Maybe you are not lazy after all.

# Q4 - Start Dialog - Spice of Life
    Now that I have charcoal I can cook my dinner. You should know that you can't eat the same stuff over and over and expect that it will fill your belly. Until recently I had a full garden, with a variety of crops. 

    Those birds nests you have been collecting might have a seed or two in them. You can also find small clusters of crops. Often you can collect seeds from the crop and replant them.

    Find me corn seeds.. 

# Q4 - Active Dialog
    You know what would be great with what I am cooking.. Eggs. I'd like to make you one of my omelettes. If we had a pig we could find truffles. You know they are great at hunting them. You have to take them on a walk in the forest.
