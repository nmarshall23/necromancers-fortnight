# 02a If you are studing Magic
    I have a freind who is knowledgeable about magic you should go meet her.
    Well, I don't know any magic.  A do know a friendly druid that lives not far form here. Maybe she can teach you. Althought I doubt she knows any thing about the magic of star light. That book you have it's about astral sorcery right?

   (GOTO Quest 01)

   Ah, so you are a scholar not a fighter. You should go see my friend the druid. 

## Response:
   - Where might she be? ( Quest 01 )
   - I don't trust druids they spend far too much time under the sun. ( - Faction Druid )

# Quest 01 Find Druid
    I'm not sure, her house moves around a lot. Maybe my memory is just playing tricks on me when it comes to her house. I know she doesn't live all that far away.
