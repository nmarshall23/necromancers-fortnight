  "Tinkers' Construct is a mod about putting tools together in a wide variety of ways, then modifying them until they turn into something else. The tools never disappear and can be named and changed to your heart's desire. Once you make them, they're yours forever. Many different materials can be used to make your tools.",
  "You will start with the Tinkers' Construct book that explains the details of how it works. Bellow I have details on the changes I have made.",
  null,
  "## Getting Started",
  "Craft a Tool Station, Part Builder, Stencil Table and Pattern Chest. Be sure to put the pattern chest by the part builder, as you can access them together. Use the Stencil Table to craft the patterns, and craft tool parts from them using the Part Builder. The part builder also displays information about the material used. Next step is the Tool Station, where  you build, modify, and repair tools.",
  "Do not forget your Sharpening Kits! If you need to repair a tool on the go, craft your tool with a sharpening kit made from the same material used to make the tool head.",
  "You can also upgrade a tool's harvest level in the Tool Station with flint and a Sharpening Kit with a better harvest level.",
  null,
  "## Casting Metal parts",
  "Craft a Tinkers' Complement Melter. Place it on top of a seared tank. Next craft a seared brick drain and a casting table. To make tool casts you will either need gold or make a Single-Use Clay cast. Once you have a cast. Use Lava to melt down any metal ores or ingots. Remember that the Melter can only hold one liquid type. So have all of the casts you will want ready.",
  null,
  "## Mixing Alloyes",
  "You will need to build a Smeltery. This requires you have blocks of Obsidian, and a Diamond.",
  "You can make Obsidian in a Smeltery. Empty a bucket of lava into the Smeltery by Clicking on a drain. Do that same with a bucket of water, this will result in molten Obsidian in the Smeltery. Drain it into a casting basin.",
  null,
  "## Changes to Tinkers' Construct",
  "I have made several small changes to Tinkers' Construct for balance and to guide the progression.",
  "Obsidian's Harvest level is now Obsidian.",
  "Steel's Harvest level is now that of Cobalt.",
  "I am aware that the tools in JEI say otherwise, I can't change those values.",
  "To Harvest Obsidian you will need a pickaxe with an Iron or Bronze head. Then you need to upgrade it with a Diamond."
